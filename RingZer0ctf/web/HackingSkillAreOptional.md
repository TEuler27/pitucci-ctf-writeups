## Solution
 
The challenge gives us only an article saying that most data breaches are caused by weak username/password combinations. It was clear that we had to log in somewhere with some standard username and password but it wasn't clear at all where. After a few days of wondering we tried to log in the RingZer0 website with the classic `admin:admin` and, surprisingly, we logged in succesfully on the first try. Navigating to the profile page we got the flag `FLAG-d844e38b9740119078ea8a8a7307591e`.
